1. ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------
This project implements a menu-driven Employee Management System using the C programming language. 
The system allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete employee records stored permanently 
in a file. It uses structures to represent employee data and demonstrates the application of file 
handling for data persistence. The project also applies modular programming concepts to build a 
clear, efficient, and maintainable management system.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. OBJECTIVE
------------------------------------------------------------
The objective of this project is to design and implement a simple, modular, and efficient Employee 
Management System using the C programming language. The system should automate key operations such as 
adding employee records, viewing details, searching for specific employees, updating information, and 
deleting entries, with all data stored persistently using file handling.

The aim is to replace manual employee record-keeping with a faster, more reliable, and organized 
digital solution while reinforcing essential C programming concepts such as structures, functions, 
arrays, file operations, and modular program organization.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. PROBLEM DEFINITION
------------------------------------------------------------
In many small offices, shops, and institutions, employee information is still handled manually, which 
often leads to mistakes, difficulty in updating records, and loss of important data. There is a need 
for a simple, reliable, and efficient digital system to store and manage employee details.

The goal of this project is to build a console-based Employee Management System in C that automates 
basic record-handling tasks and improves accuracy and accessibility.

The system shall:
• Store employee details such as ID, Name, Age, Position, Salary, etc.
• Add new employee records
• Display all stored records
• Search for a specific employee by ID or name
• Update employee information when needed
• Delete employee records
• Maintain all data permanently using file handling

This project also reinforces key C programming concepts such as:
• Structures for organizing data
• Functions for modular design
• Arrays for storing multiple records
• Text-file operations for persistent data management

6. TESTING AND RESULTS

7. FUTURE SCOPE
------------------------------------------------------------
• Allow users to edit or remove specific employee fields (name, department, salary, etc.) directly 
  from the interface with improved validation.
• Maintain a separate log file to track changes such as promotions, salary updates, and new hires 
  for better record-keeping.
• Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to replace the console-based layout, making the system 
  more user-friendly and visually appealing.

------------------------------------------------------------
8. CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------
The Employee Management System developed in C successfully provides a simple and effective way to 
manage employee information through a console-based interface. The system allows users to add new 
employees, view all records, search for specific employees, update existing details, and delete 
records, ensuring smooth and organized data handling. 

All employee information is stored permanently using file handling, making it reliable for repeated 
use without data loss.

This project demonstrates the practical application of core C programming concepts such as 
structures, functions, arrays, modular programming, and file operations. Implementing CRUD 
operations strengthened the understanding of persistent storage and record manipulation, while 
designing a structured codebase improved debugging and problem-solving skills.
